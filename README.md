✈️ Airline Review Analysis

A data analysis project exploring airline passenger reviews to understand customer satisfaction and travel experiences. The project uses Python-based analytics and visualizations to identify patterns across traveller types, seat classes, airlines, and service ratings.

📌 Project scope

- The analysis is limited to the available airline review dataset.

- Only customer-provided ratings and reviews are considered.

- Text reviews are used mainly for understanding sentiment patterns (if applicable).

- The project focuses on descriptive and exploratory analysis rather than predictive modeling.
🎯 Objectives

- Load and explore the dataset

- Clean and preprocess data

- Perform univariate, bivariate, and multivariate visualizations

- Interpret each visualization and code output

- Provide insights and recommendations

- Summarize the findings in a conclusion

💡 Key Insights (Summary)

Traveller type and seat class have a strong impact on review scores.

Business and First Class passengers tend to give higher ratings.

Service categories such as cabin staff, comfort, and food strongly influence overall satisfaction.

Certain airlines consistently perform better across multiple rating categories.

📌 Conclusion
 From the analysis of airline review data, it is evident that customer satisfaction varies significantly across different service parameters. Factors such as cabin staff service, seat comfort, and value for money have a strong influence on overall ratings. Missing values and inconsistent data required careful preprocessing to ensure accurate analysis.The visualizations helped in clearly understanding trends, distributions, and relationships between variables. Overall, the project demonstrates how data analysis and visualization can transform raw customer feedback into meaningful business insights that can support better decision-making in the airline industry.
 
🏆 RECOMMENDATION

- Airlines should prioritize improving cabin staff service, as it has a strong impact on customer satisfaction.

- Enhancing seat comfort and onboard facilities can significantly improve passenger experience.

- Improving food and beverage quality may help increase overall ratings, especially for long-haul flights.

- Ground services such as check-in, boarding, and baggage handling need consistent monitoring.

- Airlines should actively analyze customer reviews to identify recurring complaints and address them promptly.

- Regular data-driven analysis should be conducted to track customer satisfaction trends over time.
