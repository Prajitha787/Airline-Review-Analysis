💡 Key Insights (Summary)

Traveller type and seat class have a strong impact on review scores.

Business and First Class passengers tend to give higher ratings.

Service categories such as cabin staff, comfort, and food strongly influence overall satisfaction.

Certain airlines consistently perform better across multiple rating categories.

📌 Conclusion

The analysis shows that service quality consistency is the most important factor influencing customer satisfaction.

Business and Premium Economy passengers express higher satisfaction compared to Economy travelers.

Airlines with better on-board experience (cleanliness, comfort, entertainment) receive the highest ratings.

WiFi quality remains one of the weakest areas in many airlines and greatly impacts review sentiment.

🏆 RECOMMENDATION

- Improve WiFi Connectivity
   - WiFi is one of the most frequently mentioned negative aspects. Strengthening onboard internet quality can drastically improve reviews.

- Focus on Seat Comfort in Economy Class
   - Most low ratings come from Economy passengers. Improving legroom and cushioning may enhance satisfaction scores.

- Enhance Value-for-Money Services
  - Provide small perks, better meal quality, or entertainment options for lower-cost tickets.

- Staff Training
   - Friendly and supportive cabin crew repeatedly appear in positive reviews. Regular training should be enhanced.

- Monitor Feedback by Traveller Type
   - Leisure travelers prefer comfort & cleanliness.
   - Business travelers care about efficiency & WiFi.
   - Tailored improvements can help target specific groups.
